Project Coffee Machine / A Jetbrains Academy Project

Work on project. Stage 1/6: Making coffee

1.  Description

    Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee â€“ virtual coffee, of
    course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a
    real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or
    coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it
    will take money for the prepared drink.

2.  Objective

    The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print
    to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.
