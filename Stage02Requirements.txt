Project Coffee Machine / A Jetbrains Academy Project

Work on project. Stage 2/6: Ingredient calculator

1.  Description

    Now let's consider a case where you need a lot of coffee. Maybe you're
    hosting a party with a lot of guests! In these circumstances, it's better
    to make preparations in advance.

    So, we will ask a user to enter the desired amount of coffee, in cups.
    Given this, you can adjust the program by calculating how much water,
    coffee, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee.

    Of course, all this coffee is not needed right now, so at this stage, the
    coffee machine doesn't actually make any coffee.




2.  Objectives

    Let's break the task into several steps:

        1.  First, read the numbers of coffee drinks from the input.

        2.  Figure out how much of each ingredient the machine will need. Note
            that one cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains 200 ml
            of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans.

        3.  Output the required ingredient amounts back to the user.
